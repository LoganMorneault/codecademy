# codecademy

Hello! This repository holds code from the various projects available from CodeCademy. These projects are very guided and generally not that impressive, but they do serve as proof of my experience in these languages.

As of 4/30, I have completed these courses from CodeCademy:
 - Welcome to CodeCademy
 - Learn Python 2

I believe CodeCademy's paid courses have projects that are more involved, but as of 4/29/2021 I'm using only the freely available portions of each lesson plan.
